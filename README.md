## Background Context
This project was meant to be done by groups of two students. Each group of two should [pair program](https://intranet.alxswe.com/rltoken/gIcHRL9I7i1lw2CTAll37A) for at least the mandatory part.

** I did it by myself though due to some personal reasonsüòëÔ∏è **

## Learning Objectives
At the end of this project, you are expected to be able to explain to anyone, without the help of Google:

### General

* At least four different sorting algorithms
* What is the Big O notation, and how to evaluate the time complexity of an algorithm
* How to select the best sorting algorithm for a given input
* What is a stable sorting algorithm

### Tests
Here is a quick tip to help you test your sorting algorithms with big sets of random integers: [Random.org](https://intranet.alxswe.com/rltoken/YR-VWQbICB59wZs1eAaI3w)
